OTA LICENSE AGREEMENT

Version 1.0, 4 April 2025

Copyright (c) 2025 OTA Technology Inc.

Section I: PREAMBLE

Agent models are increasingly used to automate browser tasks, interpret UI elements, and issue actions in complex web environments. These models, like OTA-v1, have the potential to streamline human-computer interaction and improve productivity when used responsibly.

While these capabilities can bring substantial benefits, they also carry risks of misuse, including potential violations of ethical norms or deployment in harmful scenarios.

This license promotes both **open and responsible use** of the OTA-v1 model. Inspired by permissive open-source licensing, this agreement grants rights to use and modify the model while enforcing usage restrictions that aim to prevent abuse. All derivative versions of OTA-v1 must include, at a minimum, the same use-based restrictions outlined in this license.

This License governs the use of the model (and any derivatives thereof) and is informed by its model card and technical documentation.

NOW THEREFORE, You and OTA Technology Inc. agree as follows:

1. Definitions
- "License" means the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and Distribution defined in this document.
- "Model" refers to OTA-v1, the Browser Agent Model (BAM), including all accompanying files, learned weights, action generation components, and inference scripts.
- "Derivatives of the Model" means any modified versions, re-trained variants, or models that inherit behavior, weights, structure, or capabilities from OTA-v1, including those trained through distillation, reweighting, or other transfer methods.
- "Complementary Material" includes source code, scripts, evaluation tools, examples, and documentation provided with OTA-v1.
- "Output" means the **action sequences or commands** generated by the Model, based on observed browser context.
- "Distribution" refers to any sharing, hosting, publication, or remote availability of the Model or Derivatives to third parties, including through APIs or browser automation services.
- "OTA Technology Inc." (or "we") refers to the licensors and original developers of OTA-v1.
- "You" (or "Your") refers to the individual or legal entity using the Model under this License.
- "Third Parties" means individuals or legal entities not affiliated with You or OTA Technology Inc.

Section II: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

3. Grant of Patent License. Where applicable, OTA Technology Inc. grants You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under its patent rights to use, reproduce, and distribute the Model and Complementary Material.
